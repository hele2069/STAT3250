## Topic: Assignment 1 
##

## Two *very* important rules that must be followed in order for your assignment
## to be graded correctly:
##
## a) The file name must be exactly "assignment01.py" (without the quotes)
## b) The variable names followed by "= None" must not be changed and these names
##    variable names should not be used anywhere else in your file.  Do not  
##    delete these variables, if you don't know how to find a value just leave 
##    it as is. (If a variable is missing the autograder will not grade any of 
##    your assignment.)

##  For each question use the following lists as needed:
list01 = [2,5,4,9,10,-3,5,5,3,-8,0,2,3,8,5,2,-3,8,7]
list02 = [-7,-3,8,-5,-5,2,4,9,10,-7,9,10,2,13,-12,-4,1,3,5]
list03 = [2,-5,6,0,7,-2,-3,5,0,2,8,7,9,2,0,-2,5,5,6]
list04 = [3,5,-10,2,0,4,-5,-7,6,2,3,3,5,12,-5,-9,-7,4]
biglist = list01 + list02 + list03 + list04

## 1.  Find the product of the last five elements of list04.
import numpy as np
q1 = np.prod(list04[-5:]) # find product of all elements within the list 

## 2.  Extract the sublist of list01 that goes from
##      the 4th to the 10th elements (inclusive).

q2 = list01[3:10]

## 3.  Concatenate list01 and list04 (in that order), sort
##      the combined list, then extract the sublist that 
##      goes from the 6th to the 17th elements (inclusive).

q3 = sorted(list01+list04)[5:17]


## 4.  Generate "biglist", then extract the sublist of every 5th 
##      element starting with the 4th list element

q4 = biglist[3::5]  


## 5.  Determine the number of times that 3 appears in biglist.

q5 = biglist.count(3)


## 6.  Determine the index for the first appearance of 12 in biglist.

q6 = biglist.index(12)
